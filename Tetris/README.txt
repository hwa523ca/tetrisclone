This tetris game I have made is from this YouTube tutorial:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9esvyWcjtE

NOTE: I have followed along with this tutorial, and made my own modifications
to the game to where it's different from the tutorial.

Update (9/26/2022 1:10PM CST): I have changed the background colors from yellow to gainsboro, 
and I have noticed that after clearing a line, it doesn't clear it the way 
it's supposed to.
