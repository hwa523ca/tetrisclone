This tetris game I have made is from this YouTube tutorial:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9esvyWcjtE

NOTE: I have followed along with this tutorial, and made my own modifications
to the game to where it's different from the tutorial.

Modifications before the updates include:
    - A border outline for the game board and the next 
      piece.
    - Two more tetrominoes that were not included included
      in the video, which were both mirrored versions of the
      L shape and the Z shape the instructor mentioned. They
      are titled the J tetromino and the S tetromino
      respectively.

Update (9/26/2022 1:10PM CST): I have changed the background colors from yellow to gainsboro, 
and I have noticed that after clearing a line, it doesn't clear it the way it's supposed to.

Update (9/27/2022 12:48AM CST): I have fixed the error; however, I noticed that sometimes
when the tetrominoes fall, they would have some duplicate parts placed on the board that are
not supposed to be there. I will try to fix that error when I can. I also noticed that when
the tetrominoes have collided with either the bottom or the bottom pieces, it doesn't move
like any other game of Tetris. I will try to add a delay of some kind to ensure that part
works.

Update (9/27/2022 7:40 CST): I have added a reset button to reset the game, and I have
also added a bonus whenever someone scores a "Tetris" (which is where one clears 4 lines),
they would get 100 points instead of 40 points. I have also added some instructions on
how to play the game.
